# CS3020-Dynamic-Typing

## Milestone

Progress: 
	Although we haven't begun coding, we have discussed our implementation of dynamic typing. We will use the “easy” implementation for step 1. Once it works, we’ll move on to step 2. We've made a GitHub for sharing files and trading notes based on the in-class dynamic typing lectures. We have also made a list of test cases that should prove the program's functionality. 

|Test Cases:| |
|-----------|-----------|
|x = false<br/> y = true<br/> x + y = 1 | x = true<br/> y = 1<br/> x + y = 2| 
|if 5 == 6:<br/> &nbsp;x = True<br/> else:<br/> &nbsp;x = 42 <br/> | var = “dynamic”<br/> print(var)<br/> var = 1<br/> print(var)|
|x = 10<br/> type(x)| x = false<br/> type(x) <br/>|
|x = 0.3<br/> type(x)| x = “sigma”<br/> type(x)<br/>|
|x = ‘0’<br/> type(x)| x = (1, 0)<br/> type(x)<br/>|
